# :zap: Demo-improve-java-applications

this repository is for the Talk **Improve your [Java Applications in Intellij Idea](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d4YvpCfgT5deyJp806CaCiXTBL3h3Kggj5bHPoSrKMY/edit?usp=sharing)** 

[Build a Java app with Maven](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
